# Physics Project
This is a small project. This python script can calculate the best delta v ratio for a homan transfer (dv1 => first burn; dv2 => second burn). In the variables at the begin of the python file, you can configure what values to try. <br>
### You can configure the following values:
Startheight<br>
specific impulse<br>
mass ratio of the spacecraft (full/empty)
